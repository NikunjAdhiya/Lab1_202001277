    7. System should send the reminder email to registered student when the return date of a book is approaching

    8.The web Application should only run within the Institute LAN and should not serve any request coming from the outside of the LAN.

**Non-Functional Requirements:** 

    1. Security:

       - The system should be accessible only within the institute LAN.
       - The user privacy should be maintained in the sense of which book (s)he is borrowing
   
    2. Performance:
   
       - The system should load as less as possible.
       - At least 100 users should be able to access the system altogether at any perticular
         same time.
       - The system should accessible 24x7.
   
    3. Software Quality
      
      - Software's User interface must be easy to understand for everyone 
   
    4. Database
    
      - Database must be capable to handle multiple request

    5. Maintainability
    
    6. Reliability:
