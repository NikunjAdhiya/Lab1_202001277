## Objective:
    Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

## **<pre>                  Library Information system(LIS)   </pre>**

**Functional Requirements:**   

    1. Login
        * Student and Employee login 
        * Library staff login
        * Librarian login

    2. Students Login

        * Borrow a book and Return a book
        * If no further requests for that particular book are received,
          extend the return date.
        * If a book has previously been borrowed by another person, mark it.
        * Borrowing or returning a book require students to login
    
    2. Library Staff Login 

        * Get the current list of books that are available in the library.
        * View the unfinished borrow requests that are waiting.
        * View the list of pending return requests. 
        * Finding a book on a shelf via browsing or searching the platform.
        * View the daily transactions performed for the purpose of analysing library reach.
        
    3. Librarian Login 
        * Provide Administrative Privileges to Librarian to have  complete control over the 
          system for changing the records in the system 
        * Generate a new record to indicate the borrow of a book
        * Deletion of the record of the book that is borrowed

    4. After successful login, user will be redirected to Home Page of LIS web and from where he can use the different functionalities of LIS like:
        * search book
        * issue book
        * return book
        * reissue book
        * deadline extention of book etc.
        
    5. Non-Members should be able to freely browse the books
     
    6. As a finished result, the web application should manage concurrent login (or register) requests from users and workers.
    
    7. System should send the reminder email to registered student when the return date of a book is approaching

    8.The web Application should only run within the Institute LAN and should not serve any request coming from the outside of the LAN.

**Non-Functional Requirements:** 

    1. Security:

       - The system should be accessible only within the institute LAN.
       - The user privacy should be maintained in the sense of which book (s)he is borrowing
   
    2. Performance:
   
       - The system should load as less as possible.
       - At least 100 users should be able to access the system altogether at any perticular
         same time.
       - The system should accessible 24x7.
   
    3. Software Quality
      
      - Software's User interface must be easy to understand for everyone 
   
    4. Database
    
      - Database must be capable to handle multiple request

    5. Maintainability
    
    6. Reliability:
  
      - The system shouold be reliable to any device (mobile phones, PC, laptops, teblets 
        etc.)
   
    7. Design:
   
     - The LIS has to be developed as a web application, which should work with Google Chrome, 
       Firefox, Opera and other web browsers.

## **<pre>             Mobile application to aid hear loss:   </pre>** 

## Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

### 1. Scope

    - An Android application should be created to assist persons who have debilitating hearing 
      loss. 
    - This condition affects around 5% of the world's population. 
    - This programme will notify the user in crucial instances where quick attention is 
      necessary, such as seeing automobiles crossing the road, hearing someone yell for aid, 
      and so on. 
    - The mobile application use artificial intelligence to recognise frequent noises in 
      certain scenarios, such as a car horn.

### 2. Features
    
    - Artificial Intelligence must be core tech to detect sound in the mobile application.
    - App must be capable to sent alert to user when there is critical situation.
    - The Application must provide beolow sound events
        * Car Horns
        * Alarms
        * Emergency Siren
        * Doorbell
        * Baby Crying etc.
    -  When above events happens, corresponding image will be displayed in home page of this 
       application, So user can recognize these events correclty.
    - Phone vibration Alert.
    - Flash light Alert.
    - Notify friends and family in case when no response from the user when a critical 
      situation is detected.
    - The Application must run in the background also.
   
### 3. Non-Functional Requirements
    - The app should notify the user via vibrations.
    - Users should be allowed to add additional sounds that the app must identify.
    - The latency of the app should be less than 2 ms.
    - While travelling, the app should be able to propose the least congested lanes.
    - This app's design should be relatively basic since users would become confused if there 
      is a lot of hierarchy.
    - In an emergency, the app should be able to track users' current position and send 
      information to friends and relatives.
    - The system shouold be reliable to any device (mobile phones, PC, laptops, teblets etc.)
